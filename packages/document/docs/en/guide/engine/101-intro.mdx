## Runner

We provide a runner that is decoupled from the editor for running the data produced by the editor.

You can implement your own running system by defining the running capabilities (audio playback, animation playback, etc.) in each<code><a href="/en/guide/intro/3-data-interface.html#timelineeffect">TimelineEffect</a></code>.

+ 🛠 Provides capabilities such as setting time and running rate
+ ⚙️ Can be used independently


## Examples

You can use the runner in the following two scenarios:

### Running During Editing
> The editor has a built-in runner and provides<code><a href="/en/guide/intro/3-data-interface.html#timelinestate">TimelineState</a></code>for more convenient control of the runner.
> 
> We do not provide default runner styles; you need to customize the styles
> 
> You can easily obtain running data changes through listeners to customize your own runner style

<code src="@src/engine-demo/engine-basic/index.tsx"></code>

### Using Independently

> You can also use the runner anywhere to run the data produced by the editor
> 
> This is very useful when you want to share a set of data and running capabilities between `editing` and `runtime`
